This is ChronoBit, a secure timestamper using P2Pool. It can create proofs 
that a given timestamped data existed before a confirmation date. 

Confirmation date is generally the one of the next Bitcoin block found by 
P2Pool. User's data is hashed, then the hash is put into P2Pool's share 
coinbase, and then all the following P2Pool shares are stacked on top of
that share. Finally, some P2Pool share will become an actual bitcoin block,
and everyone can confirm the timestamp of a bitcoin block using any bitcoin
client or blockexplorer.

If you know P2Pool's shares hashes and are sure they existed at the time
they say they did, the proof's timestamp gets the granularity of P2Pool's
shares, otherwise it has granularity that of the found Bitcoin block.

INSTALLATION
  Currently none, just use the extracted .pl files and make sure configs
  are in current directory.

  The following CPAN modules will be required - get them via CPAN or your
  distro's package manager (if it has them) or otherwise make sure they're
  installed:
       
    AnyEvent
    AnyEvent::JSONRPC::HTTP::Client
    AnyEvent::JSONRPC::HTTP::Server
    Any::Moose
    Data::ParseBinary
    Digest::SHA
    Digest::SHA::PurePerl
    IO::All
    JSON::XS
    Log::Log4perl
    LWP::UserAgent
    YAML::Syck

  To create timestamps you'll also need to be mining on P2Pool, git commit
  52d0f3357b or later.

CONFIGURATION
  $ cp chronobit.conf-sample chronobit.conf
  $ cp log.conf-sample log.conf
  $ ed/vi/emacs/joe/nano/pico *.conf

  Please set your chainid as the lowest available number greater than 0,
  such that it doesn't collide with existing merged mining daemons.
  The only other merged mining chainid that I know of is that of namecoind
  and it's 1, so I set my chainid to 2.

  'proofs' is a location (relative or absolute) to where you want your proofs
  of timestamp to be stored, please make sure that this directory exists
  (you'll have to create it manually).

DOCUMENTATION
  Is currently held in this file, as well as at the top of each perl script
  in comments.

USAGE
  CREATING A TIMESTAMP
    Run chronobitd.pl. 
    Run P2Pool with --merged and point it at the running chronobitd.pl (you 
    configured the port it listens on in chronobit.conf).
    P2Pool will start querying chronobit for hashes. Take your data, sha256
    it (e.g. via the commandline sha256sum utility). Give your hash to 
    chronobitd like this:
     
     $ ./jsonrpc_client.pl http://localhost:8080 '["set_hash","<your_hash>"]'

    You should see something like:
    
     $VAR1 = bless( do{\(my $o = 1)}, 'JSON::XS::Boolean' );

    That's effectively a true value returned by chronobitd, acknowledging that
    it got your hash.
    Then wait for P2Pool to find a share (you have to be mining on P2Pool for
    this to work). When it does, chronobitd will log an INFO message saying
    something like "got p2pool share <...> for hash <...>". It will also store
    a proof from your hash to that share's hash in the proof directory.

    Chronobitd will continue to create proofs for each new P2Pool share found,
    in case the one found was orphan or dead. If you got your proof, you can
    prevent that by running:

     $ ./jsonrpc_client.pl http://localhost:8080 '["unset_hash"]'

    At any time you can also change the hash (with another set_hash) or check
    what hash is currently stored (with "debug").

    OK, now that we have a proof going from your data's hash up to a P2Pool's
    share hash, we need to create another proof from the P2Pool's share up
    to a bitcoin block. This is currently done manually. You'll have to wait
    for P2Pool to find a block, but not longer than until it forgets your
    share (which is something like 24 hours). Then you can create a proof
    between any 2 shares (a bitcoin block is also just a share):

     $ ./traverse_shares.pl <bitcoin_block_hash> <hash_of_share_with_proof>

    That might take a while and will query p2pool for share data (using
    its address taken from chronobit.conf) extensively. When it's done,
    it'll save the proof to the usual location. You can then merge your
    original proof with any number of other proofs - in order to create
    one single proof for your data up to the bitcoin block:

     $ ./merge_proofs.pl <proof1> [<proof2>...]

  VERIFYING A TIMESTAMP'S PROOF
    Just run this:

     $ ./verify_proof.pl < <your_proof>

    Notice it takes the proof on stdin, not as argument. You can make this
    tool more verbose by giving it an argument (let's say --verbose) - it'll
    then explain each step of the proof.

    Each step effectively consists of one or more of:
     - beginning SHA state (this is effectively done by P2Pool in order to
       "compress" a number of bytes that are in front of the hash into 
       a smaller state of SHA),
     - bytes to prepend,
     - the current data (current hash),
     - bytes to append.
    All this will be taken together and hashed. A step can also reverse bytes
    in the current hash.

  OPTIMIZING PROOF'S LENGTH
    More thorough documentation to be written later, have a look at
    share2proof.pl and shorten_proof_from_share.pl.
